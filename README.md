# readinggroup

## Our goal
Discuss papers at the intersection of data science, computer science, statistics, and civil engineering applications. Learn about research directions in the scientific community and potentially find cool things to apply to our own research. 

## How it works
- Meet every two weeks to discuss a paper together (in-person or zoom TBD)
- Submit paper suggestion (with the paper PDF) to [paper suggestions](https://github.com/jaewonsaw/readinggroup/tree/main/paper%20suggestions)
- Vote for paper to discuss at the end of each meeting
- Person who submitted the selected paper presents discussion slides at meeting, also uploaded to repo at the end of each meeting
- Contribute to shared google doc to keep track of major discussion points and questions
